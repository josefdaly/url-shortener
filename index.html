<h1>Url Shortener</h1>
<p>
  Hello, you have arrived at my URL shortener. It's pretty basic at this point.
  The special part about this app is that it utilizes my home-made object-relational
  mapper <a href="https://github.com/josefdaly/active-record-lite">Active Record Lite</a>
  to pull from and save to the database. Check out the whole thing
  <a href="https://github.com/josefdaly/url-shortener">here</a>.
</p>
<h3>Routes</h3>
<p>
  get <strong>lync.space/</strong> will just bring you back here.
</p>
<p>
  get <strong>lync.space/url_index</strong> will give you the contents of the database in JSON
</p>
<p>
  get <strong>lync.space/:path</strong> will redirect you to the website that
  corresponds to the :path if it is in the database.
</p>
<p>
  post <strong>lync.space/new</strong> with params['url'] = 'https://example.com'
  will generate a shortened url and save the pair to the database. The response
  is a JSON of the new row in the database table.
</p>
